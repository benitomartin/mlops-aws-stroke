This is a personal MLOps project based on a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) dataset for stroke prediction.

## Project Structure

The project has been structured with the following folders and files:

- `data:` raw and clean data
- `src:` source code. It is divided into:
    - Notebooks with EDA, Baseline Model and AWS Pipelines incl. unit testing
    - `code_scripts`: processing, training, evaluation, docker container, serving and lambda
- `requirements.txt:` project requirements

## Project Description

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains 5110  rows and 10 columns to detect stroke predictions. To prepare the data for modelling, an **Exploratory Data Analysis** was conducted where it was detected that the dataset is very imbalance (95% no stroke, 5% stroke). For modeling, the categorical features where encoded, XGBoost was use das model and the best roc-auc threshold was selected for the predictions using aditionally threshold-moving for the predictions due to the imbalance. The learning rate was tuned in order to find the best one on the deployed model.

</p>

## Pipeline Deployment

All pipelines where deployed on AWS SageMaker, as well as the Model Registry and Endpoints. The following pipelines where created:

- ✅ Preprocessing
- ✅ Training
- ✅ Tuning
- ✅ Evaluation
- ✅ Model Registry
- ✅ Model Conditional Registry
- ✅ Deployment

Aadditionally the experiments are tracked on Comel ML.
